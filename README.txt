This is a ransomware program that encrypts files in specified places.
The key used to encrypt these files will be sent to a Discord webhook, along with a "victim ID."

If the victim enters this key, the files will be restored, otherwise the program will shut without decrypting them.
Currently the program is set to target the "Pictures" and "Documents" folders of the current user.
Be careful using this, and do not run it on your computer.

It is FUD When it was created ... It Bypsss Ransomware Protection

This program is for test purposes only.
Enjoy :)
