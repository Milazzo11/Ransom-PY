This is a ransomware program that encrypts files in specified places.
The key used to encrypt these files will be sent to a Discord webhook, along with a "victim ID."

If the victim enters this key, the files will be restored, otherwise the program will shut without decrypting them.
Currently the program is set to target the "Pictures" and "Documents" folders of the current user.
Be careful using this, and do not run it on your computer.

If you accidentally run one of these programs with the default webhook set, please let me know.
You can message me at (602) 980-0650 to get the decryption key if needed.

This program is for test purposes only.
Enjoy :)
